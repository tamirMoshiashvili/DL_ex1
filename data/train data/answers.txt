1. Using loglin, the best accuracy was 86.67% on the dev-set,
   but using mlp1, the best accuracy was 87.33% on the dev-set,
   so there is a slightly better accuracy with the mlp.

# loglin with bigrams - 30 iterations, rate = 0.05 - dev accuracy 85%
# mlp1 with bigrams - 30 iterations, 10 hidden layers, rate = 0.05 - dev accuracy 83%

# loglin with bigrams - 30 iterations, rate = 1e-3 - dev accuracy 86.67%
# mlp1 with bigrams - 30 iterations, 30 hidden layers, rate = 1e-3  - dev accuracy 87.33%
