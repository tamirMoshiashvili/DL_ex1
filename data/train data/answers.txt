1. Using loglin, the best accuracy was 86.67% on the dev-set,
   but using mlp1, the best accuracy was 87.33% on the dev-set,
   so there is a slightly better accuracy with the mlp.

2. The best accuracy on the dev-set with loglin model and unigrams was 72%.
   The best accuracy on the dev-set with mlp1 model and unigrams was 69%.

3. It took about 15 to 30 iterations to solve the xor,
   with a learning rate of 0.2, and hid_dim = 5
